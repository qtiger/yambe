YAMBE is designed to allow a hierarchical breadcrumb where each page has a defined parent. This is not the wiki style and thus is probably not useful for a true wiki. However, where MediaWiki is being used more as a CMS than a wiki YAMBE comes into its own. Also, because of the way that YAMBE works it should be straightforward to implement YAMBE in parts of a wiki which need it and another breadcrumb approach in parts which do not.
